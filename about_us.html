        <p>Our founder, Capt. Hiram Frobisher, RN - the famous 19th century arctic explorer, first discovered the amazing
        lubricating properties of arctic seal oil when he noticed that the Innuit dog sled drivers accompanying
        his 1899 attempt to reach the North Pole using it to grease the runners of their dogsleds with amazing results.

        We no longer use arctic seals to make our oil, as that would be cruel, but our development team has been able replicate its amazing lubricating properties in the lab and we offer it to you, along with other amazing automotive products at our service centers.</p>
