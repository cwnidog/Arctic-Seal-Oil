Arctic-Seal-Oil
===============
1. Problem: The problem that we set out to solve was to provide a company that performs oil changes and sells small automotive items with a web site to allow customers to determine when their next oil change should be and to buy small items. The ultimate goal is to help the company, Arctic Seal Oil, to make more money.

2. Approach: we sat down before any coding was done to develop a list of nouns to help us determine what objects we would need to have to model a customer's determining when they needed and oil change and buy the small items. We then put together a simple UML-type model which detailed how the various objects interacted. We then drew up a storyboard for each page; splash, products, and about us. Each page was put together by a single person.

3. Analysis of Results: We were able to execute most of what we planned to do (a way for the customer to actually schedule the oil change fell through the cracks). The coordination with Git went generally smoothly, but was a challenge at the end, when everybody was trying to merge things in at once, but we were able to get the the merges done through the command line.
